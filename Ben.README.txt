Ben.README [wip]

Ben.README
This is a new document and still a work in progress. It‚Äôs meant to be documentation on me.

Two reasons for this to exist
The creation has helped me identify and refine my thoughts and values.
Hopefully this will help you understand me better and help us work together.

Important: NOT meant as a replacement for actually getting to know each other.

Important: If you feel I‚Äôm not meeting any of these responsibilities you‚Äôd be doing me a huge favour by letting me know as soon as possible




My Availability
TLDR; Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let‚Äôs talk.

Heard a rumour? Need clarification on something? Blocked? I‚Äôd love to hear as soon as possible. Come by my desk, stop me in the hall, shoot me a Slack message, we don‚Äôt need to wait for our next scheduled 1:1.

Feel free to put something in my calendar, don‚Äôt feel like you need to ask first.
Is my calendar full? Send me a message and I‚Äôll very likely be able to move something around.



My Assumptions
You‚Äôre very good at your job. You wouldn‚Äôt be here if you weren‚Äôt. If it feels like I‚Äôm questioning you it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm either: a) Trying to gather context. Or b) Trying to be a sounding board and rubber duck.

I‚Äôm not good at your job. You know best. I‚Äôll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but I won‚Äôt override you.

You‚Äôll let me know if you can‚Äôt do your job. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that you‚Äôre set up for success. Occasionally things slip through the cracks and I won‚Äôt know I‚Äôm letting you down.

You feel safe debating with me. I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I‚Äôm disagreeing I‚Äôm most likely just playing devil‚Äôs advocate. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.


How can I help you
Provide context. Most of my day is spent collecting, filtering and sharing context/information from across other projects, domains, and product lines. I‚Äôll try to push information to you as much as I can but feel free to ask about anything else.

Provide an outside(ish) perspective. I won‚Äôt be working on your project day to day but will be close enough to have informed thoughts.

Cheer. ‚ÄúI will celebrate your successes. If you're not a person who self-promotes, please let me do it for you. Tell me when things go well, share the things which make you proud, and I'll cheer/share appropriately.‚Äú - Del

Firefight. ‚ÄúIf my favourite opening line is "I could use a hand with...", my second favourite is "I screwed up: ...". A mistake, if shared, becomes a challenge; if hidden, becomes a failure.‚Äù - Del

Other. Please let me know how else I can help. 

How can you can help me
Do amazing work. This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.

Disagree with me. The best solutions comes from a healthy level of debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos . I‚Äôll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you‚Äôll challenge mine.

Tell me when I screw up. This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don‚Äôt notice. I need to know or I‚Äôll likely do it again.

Communicate. One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know and I‚Äôll fill you in or go find out.

Bring your friends. We‚Äôre growing the team and you know who you want to work with.


Your development
‚ÄúNo one hands you personal growth here; but it's there for the taking. It's being able to try hard things; that you might not succeed at every time. It's seeing the practices of the talented people around you; practices that you're free to steal. Or it's the advice that others will give to you; advice that you didn't always ask for but is usually a good idea to take.‚Äù 
- Steven Noble

Your career is yours. You know best how you‚Äôd like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective.

I‚Äôll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it‚Äôll be up to you to seize them. Let‚Äôs work together on this.

At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.


Feedback
Feedback is critical to both of our successes at Shopify. Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:
Safety - Unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback. Should be high
Effort - The amount of work in order to give feedback. Should be low
Benefit - How likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? Should be high

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.



Feedback cont.
When/how?
I don‚Äôt believe in storing feedback and then scheduling a time to provide it. If I have feedback to give you I‚Äôll work to provide it as soon as possible, in the moment if I can. It‚Äôs unlikely it‚Äôll start with ‚ÄúI have some feedback to give you‚Äù.

More specific?
If you‚Äôd like specific feedback on something let me know! I‚Äôm happy to provide an outside perspective.

What should you do with feedback?
Consider it. Acting on it is not required. You‚Äôll receive a lot of feedback at Shopify. Most of it will be good, some of it won‚Äôt be. Like everything else, please think about each piece critically and decide whether to act on it or not.



One on Ones
There‚Äôs a lot of variety in frequency, length and format of one on ones with my direct reports. From thirty minutes bi-weekly to an hour per week. Coffee in the cafe, private meeting room, head out for a walk, let me know what works best.

Length, frequency, format and content is up to you. We‚Äôll start with 45 minutes bi-weekly and then adjust from there.

The best 1:1s I‚Äôve had have focused beyond the moment: Your career development, team strategy and opportunity, the greater Shopify, etc. Feel free to come with a topic you‚Äôd like to discuss. I‚Äôd love it if you spent a few minutes beforehand preparing so that we can get the most of our time. 



Default to Open [WIP]
‚ÄúDefault to Open‚Äù is a core value of Shopify. All of our tools and processes are defaulted in this direction. Infrequently those defaults are overridden and there are things that I won‚Äôt be able to share before a certain date. These events are rare and always thoughtfully considered.

You can ask me anything. The vast majority of the time I‚Äôll answer. Very infrequently, I won‚Äôt be able to. But I‚Äôm committed to never lying to you.







Note: Default to Open means that the information is there if you look for it. Shopify is too large at this point for it to be possible for one person to know everything so not all information will be pushed.


What I value
Merchant focus. We‚Äôre all here to create the best product that we possibly can. That starts with a laser focus on our merchants and their customers.

Critical thinking. Nothing is sacred and we don‚Äôt do anything ‚Äúbecause we‚Äôve always done it that way‚Äù. No cargo culting.

Self reflection. Self reflection is an important part of growth. You‚Äôll miss opportunities without it.

Intentionality. We have too much to do for any of it to be random. Intentionality is important to make sure we get the results we want.

Empathy. Connecting with your customer‚Äôs emotions is incredible important to building the best product that we can. Having empathy for your co-workers will help us to build strong teams.


end
This document is new and still a wip. I‚Äôd love your feedback.
Did you find the time you spent reading this valuable?
Was something critical missing?
Were there slides included that you didn‚Äôt find useful

If you see me not living up to anything included please let me know. It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôve changed my mind (üëç). More likely I‚Äôm dropping the ball (üëé). Either way I‚Äôd like to know.
